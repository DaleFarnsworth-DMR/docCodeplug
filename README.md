## docCodeplug - Show field offsets for supported field offsets

This program reads a JSON codeplug file description
(github.com/dalefarnsworth-dmr/codeplug/codeplugs.json) and generates
corresponding human-readable documents containing the field offsets
within a codeplug for each of the various supported radios.
